# Black ops II Server Zombies Mod

Here I leave you some mods that you can put directly on the server to play with your friends. They are all drag and drop files. Just take them and put them in the correct folders and you are done. Each mod will be composed of two files, one compiled and one not completed. 
If you don't know how to make the mods, just take the compiled file and put it in the correct folder.

### Zombies Simple Mod
